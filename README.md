### Yo! I'm Sean Yager, a Full Stack Web Developer specializing in Frontend UI/UX using Vue as a framework. I'm also learning React JS.

Starting January 2021 I'm focusing on improving and updating [Moebius Dungeons](https://moebiusdungeons.com/), my Vue JS experiment that aims to create a fully fledged Monster Brawler RPG in browser. :crossed_swords:

 The game always needs playtesting, so if you'd like to play the current build click the image below.
